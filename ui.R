        The purpose of this report is to focus on Airbnb trends in Seattle,
        using datasets provided by <a href=http://insideairbnb.com/>
        InsideAirbnb</a>. <b>InsideAirbnb</b> is <i>'an independent,
        non-commercial set of tools and data that allows you to explore how
        Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world'.</i>
        Specifically, we are focusing on Seattle and working with the listings
        and neighborhoods datasets.
        <h4>Preview of Datasets</h4>
        The two main datasets we are using are listings and neighborhoods,
        the csv files of which are publicly available on InsideAirbnb.
        There are two different datasets available for listings information,
        one being a summary of 16 variables and the other being an extensively
        detailed dataset of 106 variables. The neighborhoods dataset provides a
        list of neighborhood categorizations used by InsideAirbnb."),

        These are the major questions we are exploring in this report:
         <ul><li>What kind of Airbnbs are concentrated in what Seattle
         neighborhoods?</li>
         <li>How does the location/neighborhood of a listing differ on its
        characteristics?</li>
         <li>How are Seattle Airbnb listings rated?</li>
        <li>What kind of amenities are available at Seattle Airbnbs?</li></ul>
         <h4>Visualizations</h4>
         To answer the above questions, we have analyzed the data and
         processed them into visualizations in the form of a heatmap,
         interactive tree map, scatterplots, and bar graphs. Explore the data
        with the two different kinds of maps or by different variables in their
       corresponding tabs above!
        <h4>Summary of Results</h4>
        These are the main trends that we have observed in the data:
         <ul><li>Most Airbnb listings are categorized as 'Other neighborhoods',
        followed by Downtown and Capitol Hill.</li>
         <li>Downtown has the highest proportion of Entire home/apt type
        listings.</li>
        <li>The most amount of shared room types are concentrated in Capitol
Hill.</li>
        <li>The average most expensive neighborhood is Pike Market.</li>
        <li>International District listings have the most availability.</li>
        <li>There is no correlation between rating score and price.</li>
        <li>The most commonly offered amenity is Wifi.</li>
        <li>There is no correlation between amenities and price.</li>
        <li>There is no correlation between amenities and review ratings
         scores.</li></ul>")
