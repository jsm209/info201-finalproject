    HTML("<h4>Introduction</h4>
        This report focuses on Airbnb trends in Seattle, using the
        datasets provided by <a href=insideairbnb.com>InsideAirbnb</a>.
        <b>InsideAirbnb</b> is <i>'an independent, non-commercial set of tools
        and data that allows you to explore how Airbnb is really being used in
        cities around the world.'</i> Specifically, we are focusing on Seattle
        and working with the listings and neighborhoods datasets.
        <h4>Main Goals</h4>
        These are the major questions we are exploring in this report:
        <ul><li>What kind of Airbnbs are concentrated in what Seattle
        neighborhoods?</li>
        <li>How does the location/neighborhood of a listing affect the
        pricing of Airbnb options?</li>
        <li>What time of year is most popular?</li>
        <li>Availability? Amenities? Ratings? </li></ul>
        <h4>Visualizations</h4>
        To answer the above questions, we have analyzed the data and
        processed them into three main visualizations: heatmap,
        interactive tree map, and a scatterplot. Explore these visualizations
        in their corresponding tabs above!
        <h4>Preview of Datasets</h4>
        The two main datasets we are using are listings and neighborhoods,
        the csv files of which are publicly available on InsideAirbnb.

        sorting settings."),

          Surprisingly, <i>there isn't much of a correlation between the average
          price per neighbourhood and the overall score.</i> The scores tend to 
          be high generally regardless of what the price is with the only 
          outlier being <b>University District</b> which is cheaper than most 
          neighbourhoods but also has a lower overall score.

          There is some correlation between the location and the price since

          correlation midway between the plot which goes to show which
          neighbourhoods have bigger houses listed as Airbnbs and how the
          price increases with the number of people that can be accommodated
          which is expected.

          <br />
          <i>We also see a positive correlation between the number of total

          average.

          There is a mild negative correlation between the number of total
          reviews and the year round availability which is to be expected since
          more availability would mean more visitors and hence, more reviews.
