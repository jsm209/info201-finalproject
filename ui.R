    HTML("<h4>Introduction</h4>
        This report focuses on Airbnb trends in Seattle, using the
        datasets provided by <a href=insideairbnb.com>InsideAirbnb</a>.
        <b>InsideAirbnb</b> is <i>'an independent, non-commercial set of tools
        and data that allows you to explore how Airbnb is really being used in
        cities around the world.'</i> Specifically, we are focusing on Seattle
        and working with the listings and neighborhoods datasets.
        <h4>Main Goals</h4>
        These are the major questions we are exploring in this report:
        <ul><li>How does the location and the time of year affect the
        availability and pricing of Airbnb options?</li>
        <li>How does the pricing of Airbnb options affect available
        amenities?</li>
        <li>Which locations of Seattle Airbnb listings get the most positive
        reviews and which the most negative?</li>
        <li>What kind of features and amenities are the most commonly
        available in Seattle?</li></ul>
        <h4>Visualizations</h4>
        To answer the above questions, we have analyzed the data and
        processed them into three main visualizations: heatmap,
        interactive tree map, and a scatterplot. Explore these visualizations
        in their corresponding tabs above!
        <h4>Preview of Datasets</h4>
        The two main datasets we are using are listings and neighborhoods,
        the csv files of which are publicly available on InsideAirbnb.
        Use the widget below to preview the two datasets by customizable
        sorting settings."),
